ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš”! I am currently a GKS scholar, studying Korean in Duksung Women's University. After the language program, I will be doing my Ph.D. in Culture Technology at KAIST and will be focusing mainly on machine learning applied to music and film.

I completed my master's and undergraduate degree from the University of the Philippines Diliman, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bQ__zDwAAAAJ">Dr. Franz de Leon</a> in the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory. Both of my theses were related to machine learning for music applications: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7482230">melody extraction</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9293783">music source separation</a>. While doing my master's degree, I was a Research Associate working under <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ph/citations?user=ZkpXaOsAAAAJ"> Dr. Rowel Atienza</a> in the Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory which focused on developing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPIsBhROQFVdnwGUzLCd1w">virtual reality applications</a>. Prior to going to Korea, I worked under the <a href="https://stamina4space.upd.edu.ph/">Stamina4Space program</a> implementing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=libBcmhUO4Q&ab_channel=VanTanTV">reinforcement learning</a> algorithms to microsatellite simulations for the <a href="https://stamina4space.upd.edu.ph/projects/phl-50/">PHL-50 project</a>.

In my spare time, I love to listen to music, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP09__BYNduUhtexuLQCFWQ">play the guitar</a>, travel, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/colormetaan/">take photographs</a>. Feel free to tweet me and drop a message via email.
